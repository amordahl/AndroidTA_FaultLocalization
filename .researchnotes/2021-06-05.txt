Starting to keep notes, so I don't forget the things I do day to day, haha.

Yesterday, I figured out that we're running into an exception somewhere and the JVM is failing silently (thanks for the insight, Ali). So, I have started adding logging messages pretty much everywhere to figure out where exactly we're failing.

When I changed the instrumentation to do nothing, the .class files that were generated seemed complete. Furthermore, when I modified the instrumentation to only print "TEST" beforehand, it also seemed to work just fine. However, with the instrumentation that I wrote, the class files I am getting are small and seem to only be for interface classes -- I haven't been able to find a single instance where my instrumentation works as written.

Today, my plan is to continue adding logs to figure out exactly where in the process the exception is happening.

I worked for about three hours on this today. The main takeaway is that it appears I'm trapping myself in an infinite loop by overriding visitMethodInsn.

Right now it appears that after a certain amount of time, we core dump with exit code 127. I don't know why this exit code, and I can't find good documentation telling what this means. It also says it's failing within the code of pushInteger. As I debug, it becomes clear that it's infinitely recursing.

Things to figure out: how can I make it not infinitely recurse? What calls should I be using instead?
