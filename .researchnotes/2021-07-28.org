* High-Level Goals for Today
** TODO Add code to compute most likely fault sites to coveragecomparer.
** DONE Look through Dakota's violation differences to figure out why he can't recreate the ones my script gave.
- It does not seem my script is the issue. It seems something went wrong when generating the droidbench files with AQL. Dakota will further investigate.
** TODO Investigate the dataflowsolver flowinsensitive option and see why it produces a violation.

* Meeting with Dakota
- Dakota will investigate why droidbench results are incorrect and inconsistent on the server. Probably an issue with parallelism.
- Dakota will also read the paper again and see if there is an algorithm to compute transitive closures, so we can reimplement this strategy in our own code.
