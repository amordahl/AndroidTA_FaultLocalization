* Research Notes
- I have continued attempting to debug the dataflowsolver problem.

** Theory 1: The dummy main method is incorrectly modeling the method calls.
*** Test: I went into the code to generate the dummy main method, and duplicated the line that adds callback methods in (i.e., the call to "buildMethodCall" on line 320 of AbstractComponentEntryPointCreator.java)
*** Result: This isn't the issue -- even duplicating the method changed nothing, indicating the problem is something deeper into the flow sensitive dataflow solver.

** Attempt 2: Try localizing by replacement.
*** Interesting finding -- changing the
