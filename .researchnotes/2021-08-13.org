* Individual Notes

- Today I met with Dakota to go over the conversation Dr. Wei and I had yesterday about pushing this work forward.

* TODO Fix fault localization script.

I added code to write intermediate results to disk so that on subsequent runs, we don't have to reprocess the frequency maps.

* TODO Continue investigating ground truths.

I'm continuing from my investigation yesterday into CGALGO |-> RTA. What causes it to miss the static invoke edge the second time around?

For convenience, I'm going to append my notes to the investigation from yesterday (2021-08-12.org).
