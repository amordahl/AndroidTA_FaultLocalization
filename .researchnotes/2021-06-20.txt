This update covers the last few days of work.

I have been modifying ObjSim to remove the functionality that requires the patches in a CSV. Basically, our goal is to make ObjSim continue to work as a Maven plugin, so that we can hook it into our build process and have it instrument.

Meeting with Dr. Wei:
1. Focus on first fixing this exception with the prelude transformer, then go on to hook it into flowdroid and figure out if it can handle the large program.

1. For our talk, we should start by talking about related work. Problem statement, make sure they understand what our talk is supposed to be, with motivation and necessary background.
