* Meeting with Dakota and Dr. Wei

** TODO Check if violations on wishmaster are recreatable.
** TODO Dakota needs to create the Android projects.
~1/3 of APKs are done.
** Other points discussed:
- The input to the delta-debugger should be maps telling the delta debugger what flows to preserve on each APK on each configuration.
- Then we pass this result to a fault localization.
** TODO Retool output of the violation checker.
- For each partial order, on each APK, produce a list of flows the delta-debugger should preserve.
  - For non-violations, preserve the true/false positives on both for sound/precise
  - For violations, preserve the difference.

* Dry Run of talk with Dr. Wei
- Between 7 and 8, a better animation to transition.
- 9 and 10, combine goals and contributions.
