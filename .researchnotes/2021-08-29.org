Today, we had a big discussion about the work and what the evaluation should look like. It appears I am conflating two separate questions:

1. Do I have a problem with how fault localization is generally evaluated?
2. What about our problem necessitates a different fault localization strategy?

In order to answer these questions, there are two things I need to do:

1. Look through the literature to find user studies and other evaluations of fault localization. Understand what metrics they use and what the user studies that have been done show.
2. Formalize our problem in the paper, and specify the differences in the input and how those differences require a different approach to fault localiztion (or do they?)
