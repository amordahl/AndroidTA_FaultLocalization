* TODO Objsim Debugging
** DONE Why aren't there any output files being produced?
The program isn't producing any output files, meaning that the instrumentation is not occurring.
*** TODO What is causing this?
I don't know. The problem appeared to be fixed.
** TODO What is causing PITest to fail?
*** DONE What actually is failing?
As of now, I'm unsure. It appears there is some issue when writing/reading to the SafeDataStream.
*** DONE Which I/O Operation is failing?
The I/O operation that is failing is getting the socket output stream. It throws a NoClassDefFoundError, and the only message is the name of the SnapshotTracker.java class. After going through the documentation, I can't find anywhere within this call that would throw this error.
**** Successful Ones
- Read on Profile.java:91. Reading in profiler arguments.
* TODO Talk slides
Push to tomorrow.
