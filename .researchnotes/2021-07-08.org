* Meeting with Dakota and Dr. Wei
** TODO Update checkmate to output files in groups.
** TODO Start DroidBench experiments today.
- All violations are able to minimize, except for wishmaster.

* Meeting with Dr. Wei
** Things to record from coverage
- Overhead: how does it affect performance?
- Differences between coverage:
  - Coverage differences between configs that have a violation and those that don't.
  - Within each program, how different are the coverages? Is the difference consistent between violations and non-violations?
  - Parts of flowdroid that are only executed by the faulty config?
  - *Differences in the differences of coverages on violated APKs vs. non-violated APKs.*
