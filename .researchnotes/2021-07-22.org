* Meeting with Dr. Wei
- Discussed findings from preliminary analysis of coverage information.

** TODO Items discussed
- Data show that coverage information is not sufficient to figure out root cause.
- Strange outliers in data.

* Independent Investigation
- The reason for the outlier in callbackanalyzer FAST is because InactiveActivity has no entry points according to FlowDroid.
- The reason that analyzeframeworks executes code in InterproceduralConstantValuePropagator is because of the code on line 170 in that file -- this guard is controlled by analyzeframeworks, and determines which of the methods to include in the worklist.
