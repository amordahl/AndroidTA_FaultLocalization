* Meeting with Dakota and Dr. Wei
** Status Updates
- All but two DroidBench apps are ready. (The two that are not are from IAC, which we can't really use for our research anyway.)
- FossDroid are still in progress. We have ~20 APKs remaining.
- Wishmaster is too large -- the debugger ran for ~4 days without termination.
